<h1><u>"" The Computer ""</u></h1>


<strong><u>Definition:</u></strong>
<p> 
 "The electronic machine which recieve some input, process it and<br>&nbsp; give us an output, is called as <b>""Computer""</b>.<br><br>
 Computer has two parts, which are as follow:
 &nbsp;<li>Hardware</li>
 &nbsp;<li>Software</li><br>

<strong><u>Hardware:</u></strong>
 <h5>"The physical parts of computer are called Hardware."</h5><br>Hardware is further divided into four main categories:
 <li>Input Devices</li>
 <li> Output Devices</li>
 <li> Secondary Storage Devices</li>
 <li>Internal Components</li><br><br>

 <strong><u>Software:</u></strong>
 <h5>"The Spirtual parts of the computer are called as software"</h5><br>Software is further divided into two main categories:
 <li>Application Software</li>
 <li>System Software</li><br><br>

 <strong><u>Development of Computer:</u></strong><br><br>

 Analytical Engine, generally considered the first computer,<br>
 designed and partly built by <b>"English inventor Charles Babbage"</b><br>
 in the 19th century (he worked on it until his death in 1871)<br><br>




 <strong><u>First Computer:</u></strong><br><br>
 The ENIAC <b>"Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer"</b><br>
 was the first electronic programmable computer built in the U.S.<br>
 Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much<br>
 faster, more flexible, and it was Turing-complete
